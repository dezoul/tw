The weather was just right - A pleasant sky with a nice warm breeze, which had been hanging around after a long hot summer. Both the Ceremony and the Reception took place at the historical [Living Legends](http://www.livinglegends.org.au/) in Greenvale.
<br>The picturesque Woodlands homestead along with the vast, as far as the eye can see, parklands proved to be a beautiful location for the wedding. The ceremony was set out overlooking a lush green field. It was just what it needed to be, simple and stunning.

&nbsp;

After the ceremony we took a walk with Troy & Cherine through the waist high grasslands. Cherine braved the bush in her wedding dress and Troy guided her through the tall grass. The experience has become one of our most beloved images we have taken! Somehow both of them managed to make it out of the bush unmarked... just in time for the fun night of celebrations!
