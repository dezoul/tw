Greek wedding #1 was done and dusted. We wrapped up from [Kristy & Jamie's](/works/kristy-jamie.html) wedding and flew from Santorini straight to Athens. We hopped straight into our car rental and drove 3 hours out to the beautiful village of Rodina for Greek wedding #2 - Nick & Penny's destination wedding!

&nbsp;

Rodina is located in the small town of Zacharo, and when we got there, boy were we were pooped! Luckily we had a couple of hours to recover and get our lives back on track before heading up to the church for the ceremony.

&nbsp;

Upon arrival, the church was absolutely filled with guests! There was no doubt in my mind that the whole village came out to watch this gorgeous couple tie the knot, and it wasn't too hard to see why. Nick & Penny are the most humble and down to earth couple you will ever meet! We are so honoured to have been made a part of this special day.

&nbsp;

<br>Straight after the ceremony the newlyweds took their first photos as husband and wife, together with the beautiful sunset and amazing views looking over the entire village. Absolutely stunning!

&nbsp;

<br>We then made our way to their reception which was just a stones throw away from the church. The newlyweds entered the venue with smiles from ear to ear and we all danced the night away!

&nbsp;

<br>Despite the fact that we were all sleep deprived. Nick & Penny's wedding brought us back to life with their infectious smiles and night filled with lots of laughs, amazing food and a whole lot of dancing! What a great way to end our Greek wedding adventures.

&nbsp;

So a big χρόνια πολλά to the beautiful couples, and thank you for sharing your big day with us. Until next time Greece! You've been wonderful!
