Andrew took on the responsibility of organising their wedding from beginning to end and gave Pearl the one and only task of finding herself a wedding dress… What a dream!! But wait, there's more. Not only was he planning their wedding day, but they also decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and christen their son Savvas on the same day! O….M….G!

Andrew came to us for a quick turn around in designing custom wedding invitations as well as photography & videography on the day. First up, we have the stationery.

**The brief:**
<br>Vintage Wedding Invitations, Envelope Labels, Envelope Liners, RSVP cards, Wishing well, Placement cards, Menus & Seating Arrangement Chart

**Date required:**
<br>Yesterday

Challenge accepted. Here's what we came up with, along with photos we took on their wedding day. Enjoy!
