Our first Greek wedding adventure was Kristy & Jamie's wedding located in the picturesque island of Santorini! Kristy & Jamie did an amazing job organising their wedding. It all started in the heat of the day in beautiful Oia. They held their wedding ceremony here in a beautiful white domed church surrounded by water and amazing views.

&nbsp;

The tourists in the area were loving every second of seeing a real greek wedding on their holiday! Family and friends were all so excited and snap happy as they watched the bride walk up toward the church. After the ceremony, Kristy & Jamie had organised a bus to transport all guests to the next location which was located on the other side of the island called Caldera. The view through the whole drive down to the reception was simply breathtaking! It actually gave all the guests time to soak in the scenery and realise that "Hey! We're in Santorini!" It truly was an experience in itself.

&nbsp;

Once we had arrived at the beautiful [Santorini Gem](http://www.tropicaweddings.com/the-santorini-gem/)&nbsp;we all hopped off the bus and took turns taking photos with the sunset. The views from the reception were so amazing that guests took photos with the views until the views could be seen no more. The night went on with the clouds sweeping through us as we enjoyed a night full of eating, dancing, plate breaking, more dancing, fireworks, and laughter. We were literally in cloud 9 (well… I can't say for sure what number the cloud was but it could definitely have been the 9th!) It was marvellous!

&nbsp;

After the party is the AFTER PARTY!

&nbsp;

When the party was over, there was another bus that came and collected the guests and drove them all to the after party in the center of Santorini, Fira. But for the oldies like me, the bus kindly drove us home! Another thing that I thought was very cleverly thought out by the young couple. Make sure everybody gets home safely! Now I’m not saying that all weddings should have a service to pick up and drop off their guests. But it sure is nice!

&nbsp;

All in all I think this wedding is one I’ll remember for quite some time. And now I can officially say “I’ve danced in the clouds”.
