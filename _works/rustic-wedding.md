It may be something trendy, but it is definitely a wedding style, one that allows the couple to express their creativity in any way they would like. From spending time together searching for the perfect location to making rustic signs out of weathered wood and white paint, a rustic theme is definitely a DIY brides dream come true. Many rustic weddings have a focus on the outdoors, and it is usually for couples who would like to take a more relaxed approach to their weddings. It's not likely that you'll see servers wearing white gloves and doing table service at a rustic wedding; it's much more likely that there will be a buffet that includes hearty meals in a crockpot or casserole dish or salads with apples or strawberries.

&nbsp;

When couples think rustic, some think barns and others think wineries. A barn is a little more work because it usually has to be thoroughly set up and decorated and can be hard to find. Both have their own unique flair but a wedding at a winery adds a unique experience for the guests and the photo opportunities are seemingly endless. From posing in front of casks of wine to strolling through the grapevines, wineries can be a photographers dream.

&nbsp;

Here is our stationery design for this Rustic Theme.
