Weddings are always a beautiful occasion as positive feelings and love runs high.  It’s always nice to experience such a divine occasion, especially when one is rich with tradition. So without further adieu, this is the unity of Maddy & Dan, where we had the pleasure of shooting this lovely culture rich wedding.

  Maddy & Dan’s wedding started off early in the day, with a traditional Vietnamese ceremony. The husband to be must come along to the bride’s family home, with his family and entourage to ask for permission to marry… bearing gifts of course! So with gifts of suckling pig and various other mouth watering treats, Dan and his family lined up outside Maddy’s family home. Everyone waited outside for this glorious moment, cheering Dan on as he walked through the gates to receive his bride to be.

The mornings events continued indoors, with burning incense, a traditional tea ceremony and then of course the feast!  Along with the traditional Vietnamese celebrations, Maddy and Dan also got married inside one of Melbourne’s historic churches, [Immaculate Conception](http://www.immaculateconceptionaust.com/weddings.htm) in Hawthorn.

A fun filled stroll through the city followed soon after, Dan and his groomsmen loosening up the party, with their hilarious antics and mischief!  The Celebrations continued at [Annabella Receptions](http://www.anabella.com.au/). Their reception was complete with Dan roaring into the venue on his motorcycle, Maddy holding onto the back - then came the pyrotechnics!  The sparks and smoke, created an exciting atmosphere for the first dance.

It was a long day, full of fun, shenanigans and definitely lots of laughter!

  Thank you Maddy & Dan for having us and all the very best!
